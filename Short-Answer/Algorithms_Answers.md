#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This algorithm is in the order of n because for every time n incrases, the code runs n times 


b) This one is in the order of n^2 the code runs in the order of n^2 for the double looping 


c) Order of n O(n) because the recursion goes over every bonny 

## Exercise II
In this problem, we will use recursion.
define a function called safely_drop_eggs(n):
# base case
if n <= f-1:
return 
return safely_drop_eggs(n-(f-1))
